### What is Morphing?
The face morphing algorithm morphs between faces using a common set of feature points, placed by hand on each face. To morph between two faces, you need to warp both faces to a common shape so they can be blended together.

### Implementation (On Server)
Implemented using **Python OpenCV and Dlib**. Check the Server Repo Link above.
